File system :
	- Choose clear types and notations (dirent_t, direcotry_entry_t, ..)
	- Find a way to handle errors and 'exceptions'
	- Code real functions to get long and short names
	- Separate file_descr and dir_handler into two tables.
	- Decide which fields of file_descr_t are useful
	- Relative paths in opendir
	- Use a real malloc on some heap without page-fault, or use some pointer arg
		(in readdir for instance)
	- Rigorous and clever implementation of basename, dirname and so on.
	- Duplication of function finddir
	- Add . and .. entries for root directory.
	- Remove all special tests for root directory
	- Unique names !
	- No reset of 8.3 names
	- Correctly manage cluster deletion in a chain !

Disk :
	- Manage 'out of disk' requests

Time management :
	- Access time (http://wiki.osdev.org/CMOS)
