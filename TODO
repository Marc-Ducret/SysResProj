File system :
	- Choose clear types and notations (dirent_t, direcotry_entry_t, ..)
	- Directories Improvement : open them as streams ?
	- Add some malloc and free instead of 'buffer', but this will make unsafe a lot of currently safe functions !

Screen :
	- Refresh when sleeping ? (not good)

User :
	- User rights ?

Shell:
	- tree
	- Code commands to accept input from stdin ! (not all)
	- Multiple arguments ?
	- Options ?


Global:
	- No global variable uninitialised !
