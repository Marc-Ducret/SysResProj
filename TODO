File system :
	- Choose clear types and notations (dirent_t, direcotry_entry_t, ..)
	- Use a real malloc on some heap without page-fault, or use some pointer arg
		(in readdir for instance)
	- Rigorous and clever implementation of basename, dirname and so on.
	- Duplication of function finddir
	- Directories Improvement : open them as streams ?
	- Add some malloc and free instead of 'buffer', but this will make unsafe a lot of currently safe functions !

Global organisation :
	- Folders ?
	- Manage includes !
	- Separate user and kernel code ?

Screen : 
	- Only certains process ?
	- Refresh when sleeping ? (not good)

Channels :
	- Init stream channels for stdin / stdout ?
	- Flush at \n ?
	- Non blocking syscalls ? (except if full)

User :
	- User rights ?
	- Initialisation block ?

Malloc : 
	- Test
	- Kernel one ?
